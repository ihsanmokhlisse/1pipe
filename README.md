# 1Pipe - Development Architecture Patterns & CICD Workflows

## Overview

1Pipe is a comprehensive project that serves as a reference implementation for various development architecture patterns and their corresponding CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) workflows. This repository aims to demonstrate and facilitate best practices in modern software development pipelines.

## Purpose

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Architecture Pattern Showcase**: Demonstrate various software architecture patterns and their practical implementations
2. **CICD Workflow Templates**: Provide ready-to-use CI/CD workflow configurations for different development scenarios
3. **Best Practices**: Illustrate development best practices and patterns for different types of applications

## Features

- Collection of architecture patterns with practical examples
- Automated CI/CD pipeline configurations
- Documentation for each pattern and workflow
- Integration examples with popular tools and services
